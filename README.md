# Breath Detection and RR Calculation Algorithms for Arduino Deployment



### Two main categories of implementations can be found in this repo:

## Threshold-Based
 compare a signal to its average value and detect crossings (obtain average through some filtering technique)

 filters include SMA (boxcar), FIR butterworth, IIR

## Gradient-Based
